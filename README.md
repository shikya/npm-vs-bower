# npm-vs-bower
Migrating bower to npm

In this repository Web Application is present in 'src/main/app/'
For progressive development we can use 'node http-server'

Here Bower is package manager which deals with front-end dependancies
Npm is a package manager which manages for devloper dependacies

#Installation

npm install

#Run

npm start

#nginx run

Nginx can directly point to 'src/main/app' as all dependancy are inside app directory.
